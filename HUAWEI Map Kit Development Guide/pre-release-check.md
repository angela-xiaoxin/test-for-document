Huawei provides a tool that fully automates checking of apps. You simply fill in the app information and upload the APK, and the tool will scan your APK and provide you with a report. You can then optimize your app based on the report for improved performance.

For details about the check procedure, please refer to  [Self-check Before Release](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-auto_check)  at the AppGallery Connect help center.
